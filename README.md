The code is for multi-threads lda based on the original c code of David blei. (see http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/topicmodeling_software.html)

Variational inference of LDA in C.

The usage is totally same as the original code, except that you need set the thread number in setting.txt .

Many thanks to David blei's group.
